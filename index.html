        <h1>History of Weightlifting</h1>
        <h2>What is Weightlifting?</h2>
        <p><strong>Weightlifting</strong> is a sport where athletes lift barbells loaded with weights. <strong>Weightlifting</strong> tests the <strong>strength, power and technique</strong> of athletes.
        </p>

        <h2>By whom, where and when was Weightlifting invented?</h2>
        <p>Weightlifting has <em>ancient origins</em>. It was practised both by <em>ancient Egyptian</em> and <em>Greek</em> societies. It developed as an international sport primarily in the 19th century, and is one of the few sports to have featured at the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896.
        </p>

        <p>At the beginning of the century, Austria, Germany and France were the most successful nations. However in the 1950s, the Soviet Union’s weightlifters rose to prominence and stayed there until the 1990s, when China, Turkey, Greece and Iran catapulted to the lead. In the women’s field, China has been dominant since the very beginning.

        <h2>A sport for everyone</h2>
        <p>You don't have to be a bodybuilder or a professional athlete to reap the benefits of weight training. When done correctly, weight training can help you: 
        <ul>
            <li>Lose fat</li>
            <li>Increase your strength and muscle tone</li>
            <li>Improve your bone density</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, if done incorrectly, weight training may not provide these benefits and could even lead to injury.</p>
